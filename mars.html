        <h1>Mars</h1>
        <p>
          The fourth planet from the Sun, Mars is a dusty, cold, desert world
          with a very thin atmosphere.
        </p>
        <p>
          This dynamic planet has seasons, polar ice caps and weather and
          canyons and extinct volacanoes, evidence of an even more active
          past. Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system,
          and it's the only planet where we've sent rovers to roam the alien
          landscape. NASA currently has three spacecraft in orbit, one rover
          and one lander on the surface and another rover under construction
          here on Earth. India and ESA also have spacecraft in orbit above
          Mars.

        <h4>Small planet</h4>
        <p>
          If the Sun were as tall as a typical front door, Earth would be the
          size of a dime, and Mars would be about as big as an aspirin tablet.

        <h4>Fourth rock</h4>
        <p>
          Mars orbits our Sun, a star. Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun
          at an average distance of about 228 million km (142 million miles)
          or 1.52 AU.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-item">
        <h4>Longer days</h4>
        <p>
          One day on Mars takes a little over 24 hours. Mars makes a complete
          orbit around the Sun (a year in Martian time) in 687 Earth days.

      <div class="grid-item">
        <h4>Rusty planet</h4>
        <p>
          Mars is known as the Red Planet because iron minerals in the Martian
          soil oxidize, or rust, causing the soil and atmosphere to look red.

        <h4>Rugged terrain</h4>
        <p>
          Mars is a rocky planet. Its solid surface has been altered by
          volcanoes, impacts, winds, crustal movement and chemical reactions.

        <p>
          Mars has a thin atmosphere made up mostly of carbon dioxide (CO2),
          argon (Ar), nitrogen (N2), and a small amount of oxygen and water
          vapor.

        <h4>Many missions</h4>
        <p>
          Several missions have visited this planet, from flybys and orbiters
          to rovers on the surface.The first true Mars mission success was the
          Mariner 4 flyby in 1965.

    <h3>Exploration</h3>
    <p>
      Because Mercury is so close to the Sun, it is hard to directly observe
      from Earth except during dawn or twilight, when the Sun's brightness
      doesn't outshine little Mercury. However, 13 times each century,
      observers on Earth can watch Mercury pass across the face of the Sun, an
      event called a transit. These rare transits fall within several days of
      8 May and 10 November. The first transits of Mercury in the 21st century
      occurred May 7, 2003, Nov. 8, 2006, and May 9, 2016. The next one will
      be Nov. 11, 2019.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first spacecraft to visit Mercury was Mariner 10, which imaged about
      45 percent of the surface. And the MESSENGER spacecraft flew by Mercury
      three times and orbited the planet for four years before crashing on its
      surface. The European Space Agency launched their first mission to
      explore Mercury—BepiColombo—in 2018.
    </p>
    <ul class="dates">
      <li>
        1631: Thomas Harriott and Galileo Galilei observe Mercury with the
        newly invented telescope.
      </li>
      <li>
        ​1631: Pierre Gassendi uses a telescope to watch from Earth as Mercury
        crosses the face of the Sun.
      </li>
      <li>
        1965: Incorrectly believing for centuries that the same side of
        Mercury always faces the Sun, astronomers using radar find that the
        planet rotates three times for every two orbits.
      </li>
      <li>
        1974-1975: Mariner 10 photographs roughly half of Mercury's surface
        during three flybys.
      </li>
      <li>
        1991: Scientists using Earth-based radar find signs of ice locked in
        permanently shadowed areas of craters in Mercury's polar regions.
      </li>
      <li>2008-2009: MESSENGER observes Mercury during three flybys.</li>
      <li>
        2011: MESSENGER begins its orbital mission at Mercury, yielding a
        treasure trove of images, compositional data and scientific
        discoveries.
      </li>
      <li>
        2015: MESSENGER is deliberately crashed into Mercury after expending
        all its propellant, ending its mission.​
      </li>
      <li>
        2018: BepiColombo launches with a target date for Mercury orbit
        insertion of 2025.
      </li>
