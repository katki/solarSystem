                        <h1>Jupiter</h1>
                        <p>Jupiter has a long history surprising scientists—all the way back to 1610 when Galileo
                            Galilei found the first moons beyond Earth. That discovery changed the way we see the
                            universe.</p>
                        <p>Fifth in line from the Sun, Jupiter is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system – more
                            than twice as massive as all the other planets combined.</p>
                        <p>Jupiter's familiar stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water,
                            floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot is a giant
                            storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years.</p>

                            If the Sun were as tall as a typical front door, Earth would be the
                            size of a dime, and Mars would be about as big as an aspirin tablet.
                        </p>

                            Mars orbits our Sun, a star. Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun
                            at an average distance of about 228 million km (142 million miles)
                            or 1.52 AU.

                            One day on Mars takes a little over 24 hours. Mars makes a complete
                            orbit around the Sun (a year in Martian time) in 687 Earth days.

                            Mars is known as the Red Planet because iron minerals in the Martian
                            soil oxidize, or rust, causing the soil and atmosphere to look red.

                            Mars is a rocky planet. Its solid surface has been altered by
                            volcanoes, impacts, winds, crustal movement and chemical reactions.

                            to rovers on the surface.The first true Mars mission success was the
                            Mariner 4 flyby in 1965.

                <h3>Exploration</h3>
                <p>While Jupiter has been known since ancient times, the first detailed observations of this planet were
                    made by Galileo Galilei in 1610 with a small telescope. More recently, this planet has been visited
                    by passing spacecraft, orbiters and probes.

                </p>
                <p> Pioneer 10 and 11 and Voyager 1 and 2 were the first to fly by Jupiter in the 1970s, and since then
                    we’ve sent Galileo to orbit the gas giant and drop a probe into its atmosphere. Cassini took
                    detailed photos of Jupiter on its way to neighboring Saturn, as did New Horizons on its quest for
                    Pluto and the Kuiper Belt. NASA’s Juno spacecraft, which arrived in the Jovian system in July 2016,
                    is currently studying the giant planet from orbit.</p>
                <ul class="dates">
                    <li>1631: Thomas Harriott and Galileo Galilei observe Mercury with the newly invented telescope.

                    <li>​1631: Pierre Gassendi uses a telescope to watch from Earth as Mercury crosses the face of the
                        Sun.</li>
                    <li>1965: Incorrectly believing for centuries that the same side of Mercury always faces the Sun,
                        astronomers using radar find that the planet rotates three times for every two orbits.</li>
                    <li>1974-1975: Mariner 10 photographs roughly half of Mercury's surface during three flybys.</li>
                    <li>1991: Scientists using Earth-based radar find signs of ice locked in permanently shadowed areas
                        of craters in Mercury's polar regions.</li>
                    <li>2008-2009: MESSENGER observes Mercury during three flybys.</li>
                    <li>2011: MESSENGER begins its orbital mission at Mercury, yielding a treasure trove of images,
                        compositional data and scientific discoveries.</li>
                    <li>2015: MESSENGER is deliberately crashed into Mercury after expending all its propellant, ending
                        its mission.​</li>
